<h1>Steps to Creating a Virtual Machine (Azure)</h1>

To begin you will create an Azure account with the following link https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/

Once the resource group is created you can begin the process of creating your virtual machine

From your Azure home page under "Azure Services" select "Virtual Machines" another way to access the virtual machines service is just by typing it into the search bar of your portal

It will then bring you to a screen that shows No virtual machines to display, right underneath you will see "Create" in which you want to select and then from there select "Azure Virtual Machine"

On the next screen you will name your virtual machine, select the image aka the operating system, and create a user account for your virtual machine

The image below shows that I have selected Windows 10 as the operating system running on a standard vcpu with 16gb of RAM and the username is LABUSER

</p>
IMPORTANT: Do not forget the username or password you created as this will be used to login to your virtual machine



Select "Review + Create" located at the bottom left corner and the "Create" on the next screen

Now in the Virtual Machines window you should see your VM where it once said "No virtual machines to display" 

As shown below mine is named "VM1"
